This project is a computer vision-based system that counts people as they enter and exit a specific lane. It is designed to track a defined flow of people while ignoring all others, providing accurate occupancy data for a chosen area.

Features
Lane-Specific Counting: Tracks people crossing a predefined line or zone.
Real-Time Data: Provides a live count of people entering and exiting the area.
Background Filtering: Ignores people who are not in the designated counting zone.
Simple & Effective: Built to be a straightforward solution for basic people counting needs.

How It Works
It uses yolo and masking to make yolo ignore the place where we dont want to count.

Why I Made This
I built this project to explore practical applications of computer vision. 

uses:

Guest Management
Smarter Staffing: Schedule staff for busy times to reduce wait times.
Prevent Crowds: Keep spaces from getting too full for comfort and safety.

Predict Trends: Use data to plan for future events and busy seasons.

Security
Real-time Occupancy: Know the exact number of people inside for safety and legal limits.
Faster Emergency Help: Provide accurate headcounts to first responders.
Spot Problems: Find unusual activity patterns that could signal a security issue.
Resource Allocation: Place security guards in the right spots at the right times.

Retail and Business
Boost Marketing: See if your window displays are effective by tracking how many people enter.
Optimize Stores: Use foot traffic data to place products in the best spots.
Energy Savings: Automatically turn off lights and adjust A/C in empty rooms.

Public Spaces
